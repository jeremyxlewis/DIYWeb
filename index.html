							<h2>Get Creative</h2>
							<h5>Choose website design</h5>
								<p>Visit <a href="https://html5up.net/">HTML5 UP</a> and browse the library of HTML templates. All designs are fully responsive across all devices, super customisable for any need and 100% free under creative commons. Download the files to your computer and extract. Rename the folder.</p>
							<h5>Install Visual Studio Code</h5>
								<p>Visit <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, download and install. Be sure to select the correct operating system. To view changes in real time we will need to install 'Live Server'.Select 'add worspace folder' workspace and select your folder.</p>
							<h5>Live Preview</h5>
								<p>Click on index.html this is where we will be doing the bulk of our changes. Right click, and select 'open with Live Server' to get see changes as you make them. If you have an adjustment you need to select 'CMD S'(ON MAC) and 'CTL S' (ON PC) to see the changes. This will refresh the pages with the updates. If you made an adjustment you wish to undo, 'CMD Z' (ON MAC) and 'CTL Z' to undo the changes.</p>
							<h5>Update Text </h5>
								<p>Scrolling around the index.html you will be able to get an idea of what sections effect what part of the website. If your selected template has an elements sections you will be able to view the styles of elements you can add such as diffrent sizes of headings, lists, tables, icons, buttons and contact form. Within the index.html section you can navigate and change all text to suit and remove anything you do not wish to keep. Be mindful you will need to keep the "DESIGN: HTML5 UP" attribution due to the site being lisenced as free under creative commons AKA free as long as you show credit. If you would like to legally be able to use the website without the attribution you will need to visit <a href="https://html5up.net/license">HTML5 UP License</a>.</p>
							<h5>How to change images</h5>
								<p>The images that will be used can be located within the images folder that hosts your website. You need to be mindful of their names. If you would like to replace a prticular demo image you will need to replace it with your new image which will have the exact same name. The names of your images link directly to the code within your website. Free images can be found at <a href="https://unsplash.com/ ">Unsplash</a> for free commercial and non-commercial use. One is being used for this site now. For speed purposes I do suggest compressing all images using <a href="https://imagecompressor.com/">an image compressor</a> to ensure website load times are resonable.</p>
							<h5>How to update websites Meta and ALT Tags</h5>
								<p>Side note, in some of the <code>code boxes</code> have needed to add a space to some of the tags so you can actually see the code. If you're copying and pasting code simply remove any spaces inbetween '<' and '>'. If you get stuck, refer back to the code already within your html file. Updating your websites title can be updated by finding the <code> < title > ADD TITLE HERE < /title ></code>. Adding a META description for your website will help with search engine optimization and and allow you to customise the text which the search engines show as a preview within their search results. This is done by adding or editing the <code> < meta name="description" content="This is where you include the description of your web page." ></code> section within your header. Finally you may want to update your images alt tags which will help with SEO as it tells the search engines what your images are. This can be updated by simply filling in the quotation marks for each image. eg <code>< img src="/images/pic.jpg" alt="ADD NEW TEXT HERE" ></code>. You can link up your social media accounts to the icons in the footer by filling in the quotation marks with the URL to that particular social account. <code> < li>< a href="#" class="icon brands fa-twitter"></code>. The email icon is the same as the previous however you wont use a URL, instead you need to use <code>mailto:email@example.com</code> within the quaotaion marks.</p>
							<h5>Add more pages</h5>
								<p>The website you create does not have to be a one page website. You can add more by adding another ".html" file into your websites folder (The same file location as 'index.html'). You can link to that particular html file by embedding a link <code>< a href="addsecondpagefilenamehere.html">Second Page< /a > </code> or preferable adding a button <code>< a href="addsecondpagefilenamehere.html" class="button">Add Button Text Here< /a ></code>. </p>
							<h5>How to connect emails</h5>
								<p>Your website should have a contact form and this will need to be configured so that it actually works. We will be using a free service <a href="https://app.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> later. This is where we can configure domains and emails. For now we will need to add <code>data-netlify="true"</code> to the form section. More information can be found at <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/#html-forms">Netlify Form Setup</a>.</p>
							<hr />
							<h2>Host Your Website</h2>
							<h5>Create Github account</h5>
								<p>In a future update I will show you how to directly push updates to your website from VSCode but for the moment we will be uploading our websites files directly to Github. If you want to stick to the basics and not update your website from VSCode, you can skip this step and go straight to the Netlify section of this tutorial.</p>	
								<p>Now that we are happy with our website we need to sign up to <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> so we can host our website for free.</p>
							<h5>Create Repository</h5>
								<p>One you have your account set up you will need to create a <a href="https://github.com/new">New Repository</a> which will be where your websites files will be hosted. Name your repository then select 'create repository'</p>
							<h5>Upload Website</h5>
								<p> Open the main folder holding your website files and select all the files wintin it and drag them into github. You cannot drag in your websites master folder in as the website needs access to index.html as that is the 'Home Page' of your website. Once uploaded "Commit Changes" </p>	
							<h5>Netlify</h5>
								<p>Netlify is where we will be pushing out website too and manage the its settings. Visit <a href="https://app.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and sign up for a free account. Select 'New site from Git' (if using Github) or drag in the website files. Connect to Github, select the repository that hosts your files then select 'Deploy site'. Congratulations, your website is now live. However as is the URL will be random. You can update this within the domain settings and have a <code>itnsertwebsitenamehere.netlify.app</code> .netlify.app extention. You dont have to update this as I will show you how to add a custom domain.</p>
								<hr />							
							<h2>Final setup</h2>									
							<h5>Connect Email</h5>	
								<P>Within your websites 'Overview' section select 'Forms' then 'Settings and usage'. Netlify offers a base rate of 100 submissions a month with options to upgrade should you exceed that. Under 'Form notifications' select 'Add notification' then 'Email notifications'. Enter the email you wish the contact email to be sent too. The 'Form' options is incase you have multiple contact forms within your website. Any email client will do however if you're after a secure service that doesnt read or sell your data to avertisers check out <a href="https://protonmail.com/">Protonmail</a>.</P>
							<h5>Connect Domain</h5>
								<p>If you already have a custom domain you will need to look up your domain providers configuration settings. If you do not already own a custom domain you can use a service called <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> dont let the name fool you its a permium provider with competitive pricing. You will need to sign up, search for a domain and purchase it. On Netlifys domain settings select 'Add custom domain', type your domain in and click 'Verify'. It will ask if youre the ownerand you will need to select 'Yes, add domain'. Your domain will now be listed and needs to be configued, select 'Check DNS configuration'. This will give you a nameservers to add in your domain providers settings. Back on Namecheap or other (domain provider) locate your domain and select 'Manage'. Under 'Nameservers' you will need to add the namerserver information from Netlify by changin Basic DNS to Custom DNS then adding in all the information and saving. These changes might take up to 48hrs.</p>
							<h5>HTTPS</h5>
								<p>Within doamin managment you can scroll to the bottom and select 'Verify DNS configuration'. This may not work until your DNS configuration is pointing at Netlify servers which may take upto 24hrs.</p>
